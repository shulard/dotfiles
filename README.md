# shulard's Dot files

Here is my custom configuration for working computer. Since I mostly use a Mac, there is some specific commands for that environment.

## Usage

### On a mac

Run the `make macos` command to prepare the environment.
All the corresponding software will be installed.

### Custom configuration

Run the `make init` command which will configure the new computer with dot files. It'll also load the SSH keys and the GPG keyring.
